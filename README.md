# Security Issues in Cloud Computing
Research papers
Cloud computing is a set of services that provided by different IT vendors for rental to perform our activities in software era. Usually cloud computing services are delivered by a third party provider who owns the infrastructure. It advantages to mention but a few include scalability, resilience, flexibility, efficiency and outsourcing non-core activities. Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services without upfront investment. But as more and more information on individuals and companies are placed in the cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an environment it is. Despite of all the hype surrounding the cloud, customers are still reluctant to deploy their business in the cloud. Customers must demand transparency, avoiding vendors that refuse to provide detailed information on security programs. Ask questions related to the qualifications of policy makers, architects, coders and operators, risk-control processes and technical mechanisms and the level of testing that's been done to verify that service and control processes are functioning as intended, and that vendors can identify unanticipated vulnerabilities.

SECURITY ISSUES IN CLOUD COMPUTING

--> Software as a Service (SaaS)
-->Platform as a service (PaaS)
--> Cryptography

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
RQ1: First, virtualized networks offer insufficient networkbased controls.Given the nature of cloud services, the administrative access to IaaS network infrastructure and the ability to tailor network infrastructure are typically limited

for example, friendly scans can’t be distinguished from attacker activity.

RQ2: The second challenge is in poor key management procedures.

RQ3: there are no standardized cloud-specific security metrics that cloud customers can use to monitor the security status of their cloud resources.


SUMMARY:
Cloud computing has started new era in the internet world not only for data storage but also on the availability, Security
and maintenance. However we need to understand the security
issues or any challenges among all cloud based technologies
before committing the code or data in third party. In this
paper I have concentrated major security issues and few
vulnerabilities in different models and services.
Vulnerabilities that are relevant for all cloud computing
components typically concern the provider or rather users’
inability to control cloud infrastructure as they do their own
infrastructure. Among the control challenges are insufficient
security audit possibilities, and the fact that certification
schemes and security metrics aren’t adopted to cloud computing.
Further, standard security controls regarding audit,
certification, and continuous security monitoring can’t be
implemented effectively.
